# javascript-clock

** Functioning clock made with CSS and vanilla JavaScript! **

This was a fun little project created by Wes Bos - the starter files were created by him and are available at JavaScript30.com

This project is small and simple, but it allowed me to gain some nice experience using JavaScripts built in Date object, something I never had any previous experience with but was always curious about.

I've also used the cubic bezier timing function in the past, but this one really brought the tick of the seconds hand to life! Also, Wes's instructional video taught me that Chrome DevTools has a really neat cubic bezier editor built in.
